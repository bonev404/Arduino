# Introduction

## In this project we make a Smoke Detector Alarm using Arduino. When the MQ2 Gas Sensor will detect the smoke level high the buzzer will start.

# Components Required
Arduino NANO -> A microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P

MQ2 Gas Sensor -> Which detects the level of smoke

Buzzer -> A device that produces sound or alarm

100ohm Resistor -> To resist the current

Jumper Wires -> For connecting the elements of the circuit
